## Will de Montmollin

I’m Will, a recent graduate of [Maker's Academy](https://apply.makers.tech/tech-skills-bootcamp-in-software-engineering) tech bootcamp. I'm an aspiring developer with experience in developing web and mobile apps using the MERN stack, React Native and Ruby with Active Record. I love to understand what makes things work. 

Before Makers, I had a variety of roles: an administrator and grower at a community garden, a barista and an english language teaching assistant. I find coding exciting because it  engages my creativity and problem-solving. Tech has been a big part of my life since I was a kid, and learning to code feels like a peek behind the curtain of what makes modern life move.

#### Logistics

I have an analytical mind and enjoy problem-solving, which is often reflected in my professional life. In my time at OrganicLea, I went from being a trainee to becoming an integral part of the distribution team. During the pandemic, the box scheme doubled its customer base, and I'm proud to have contributed up-scaling changes that maintained the box pack's smooth running and pleasant atmosphere for volunteers and workers. Sometimes the pack would not go to plan or the produce delivery had to change last-minute. I often had to think on my feet and make decisions that would minimize the impact on the pack and lower the stress for everyone involved. When ordering produce for the scheme, I had to balance the packing team's capacity, our weekly budget, the needs of our suppliers, and our aim to deliver a variety of high-quality, fresh and local veg to our customers. 

<!-- Analytical mind, problem solving, use veg box as example (100% growth) -->

#### Teamwork

I'm a calm, easy-going person who is conscious of other people's moods and needs. Throughout my experience professionally and as a student, I've often received compliments on my calm demeanour, level-headnesses, and ability to keep the team motivated and on track. The retros and stand-ups that I facilitated during group projects at Maker's were often the most productive and rewarding. I also proposed daily mood check-ins that were well-received and fostered team cohesion. During my time at Edventure, our group had to work to strict deadlines to organize events and present our project to stakeholders; Afterwards, I was recognized by my group for keeping us focused and preventing us from feeling overwhelmed in otherwise high-pressure situations. I was also complimented for my ability to give and recieve feedback in a way that was non-judgemental and productive.
