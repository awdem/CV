## Will de Montmollin

I’m Will, a recent graduate of [Maker's Academy](https://apply.makers.tech/tech-skills-bootcamp-in-software-engineering) tech bootcamp. I'm an aspiring developer with experience in developing web and mobile apps using the MERN stack, React Native and Ruby with Active Record. I love to understand what makes things work. 

Before Makers, I had a variety of roles: an administrator and grower at a community garden, a barista and an english language teaching assistant. Tech has a been a big part of my life since I was a kid, and I find coding exciting because it feels like a peek behind the curtain of our lives, it engages my creativity and problem solving, and its possibilities could change society for the better.
