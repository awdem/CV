## About Me

A recent graduate of [Maker's Academy](https://apply.makers.tech/tech-skills-bootcamp-in-software-engineering) tech bootcamp, I'm an aspiring developer with experience in developing web and mobile apps using the MERN stack, React Native and Ruby with Active Record. I love to understand what makes things work. 

Before Makers, I had a variety of roles: an administrator and grower at a community garden, a barista and an English language teaching assistant. I'm passionate about food and sustainability, and my dream is to work on technical solutions to issues in our food system that don't lose a connection to the earth.

 I find coding exciting because it engages my creativity and problem-solving. Tech has been a big part of my life since I was a kid, and learning to code feels like a peek behind the curtain of what makes modern life move.

<!-- Relate to technical environment where possible, e.g. makers -->

#### Logistical Thinking

I have an analytical mind and enjoy problem-solving, something that is often reflected in my professional life. In my time at OrganicLea, I went from being a trainee to becoming an integral part of the distribution team. During the pandemic, the box scheme doubled its customer base, and I'm proud to have contributed up-scaling changes that maintained the box pack's smooth running and pleasant atmosphere for volunteers and workers. Sometimes the pack would not go to plan or the produce delivery had to change last-minute. I often had to think on my feet and make decisions that would minimize the impact on the pack and lower the stress for everyone involved. When ordering produce for the scheme, I successfully balanced the packing team's capacity, our weekly budget, the needs of our suppliers, and our aim to deliver a variety of high-quality, fresh and local veg to our customers. 

<!-- Analytical mind, problem solving, use veg box as example (100% growth) -->

#### Teamwork

I'm a calm, easy-going person who is conscious of other people's moods and needs. When working in teams throughout my professional and student experience, I've often received compliments on my calm demeanour, level-headnesses, and ability to keep the team motivated and on track. Here are some recent examples: the retros and stand-ups that I facilitated during group projects at Maker's were often the most productive and rewarding; I also proposed morning mood check-ins that were well-received and fostered team cohesion. During my time at Edventure, our group had to work to strict deadlines to present our project to stakeholders and to organize events; Afterwards, I was recognized by my group for keeping us focused and preventing us from feeling overwhelmed in otherwise high-pressure situations. I was also complimented for my ability to give and recieve feedback in a way that was non-judgemental and productive.

<!-- listener, calming, funny, easy going use edventure MSc or vegbox as example 
able to bring up conflicting personalities in a healthy and productive way?

be more specific with examples, bring it back to tech-->

#### Communication
I have a solid range of written and spoken communications skills gained by experience. I aim for clear and concise communication in whatever I do. I've produced or edited a variety of written work: weekly newsletters, magazine articles, my MSc thesis and scientific research. This experience came in handy at Makers: first, when refactoring my code to make it clean, presentable, and adhering to convention; and, second, when writing clear, well-documented pull requests that helped reviewers understand what I'd done and why. I also have speaking experience. At Edventure, I presented our business idea to stakeholders, and I wrote a press release that was picked up by several local media outlets. During my MSc, my courses almost exclusively had oral exams, and I had many opportunities for public speaking, so I feel confident presenting complex topics clearly. At Makers, I led or spoke during all of my group work presentations and was responsible for explaining our code and fielding questions about it.
